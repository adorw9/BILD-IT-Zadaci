/*
 * (Algebra: perfect square) Write a program that prompts the user to enter an
 * integer m and find the smallest integer n such that m * n is a perfect
 * square. (Hint: Store all smallest factors of m into an array list. n is the
 * product of the factors that appear an odd number of times in the array list.
 * For example, consider m = 90, store the factors 2, 3, 3, 5 in an array list.
 * 2 and 5 appear an odd number of times in the array list. So, n is 10.)
